So... you have to comment out the GenData function after you generate the faker data for the first time. (You can also manipulate how much data you want generated).

I struggled a bit but through Corey and Emily's help I figured it out. I'm going to work through PyQT to make it 'prettier' on the front end, I have just had a lot of work stuff/interviews this week so I was really overwhelmed. 

Luckily I did enjoy building it because I've been having a Marvel-fest.
